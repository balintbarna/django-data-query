# django-data-query

This project is a solution to an [interview test question](https://github.com/mark-dessain-maersk/interview-question/tree/v1). Django was chosen for this project because I have not used it before and it was a fun way to learn. Unit tests are included for the search API.

Requires Python 3
Installing dependencies with Pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the project from the dataquery directory:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

To run it on port 8080 use:
```
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

To run unit tests
```
python manage.py test
```
